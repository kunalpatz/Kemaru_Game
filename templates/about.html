        Welcome to Kemaru Game, A basic puzzle game created for fun and logic to play with a focus.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        Kemaru is a uniquely satisfying puzzle in which a grid is divided into outlined blocks,</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        each containing up to five cells. Every cell must contain a number from 1 to 5</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        (depending on the number of cells in the block).</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        The solver has to fill each cell so that no two identical numbers touch â€“ not even diagonally.</p>
